This is still highly experimental, but at least celery seems to work:

Make sure you have redis installed, and running in a terminal window:

redis-server

In another terminal window, execute:

celery worker -A app.cel_app -I config -c 3 --loglevel=info

And for the beat, also in a terminal window:

celery beat -A app.cel_app
