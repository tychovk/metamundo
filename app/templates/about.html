            <h3>About Metamundo</h3>
            <p>
                I wanted to create a project that in its principles is simple, but has the potential to deliver some unexpected, funny, and interesting results. With the "give tools, see what happens" idea, I intend to write some simple rules about 'blobs' in this game, and see what people come up with.
            </p>
            <p>
                As of the 23th of June, 2016, there are not a lot of dynamics yet. But ho and lo! More is coming up! I ensure that whatever happens, the 'live' version, does not throw any bugs, so bear with me while I add new features.
            </p>

                <div>
                    <h4>v1.1 <span class="pull-right">04-07-2016</span></h4>
                    
                    <p>Welcome back! I've been working on JavaScript &#38; HTML5 Canvas foolishness to see if I have a player walk around in the world, with a nice background and such. It's still very simple, but having the background images prerender before they come into view correctly, actually wasn't all that simple. Probably there's a kind of JS library for it somewhere, but where's the fun in that when we're learning the flexibility of the language.</p>
                    
                    <p>Besides that, there are a couple of new, small changes live:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The state (on/off) of the blob population control now persists through new pages.</li>
                        <li>Not entering numbers for coordinates now tell you what's what. That's right.</li>
                        <li>Tiny layout changes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>So either way, stay tuned for the 'walking around in the blobworld' shenanigans. Also - do you still not know what blobs are? Well ...</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h4>v1.0 <span class="pull-right">23-6-2016</span></h4>
                    
                    We're live! So what's new: everything you see.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Introduction page</li>
                        <li>Control panel</li>
                        <li>Navigation bar</li>
                        <li>About page</li>
                    </ul>
                    But honestly, most of it is just a shell. Will all be swell? Time will tell.
